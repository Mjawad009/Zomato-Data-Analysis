# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

Python and its following libraries are used to analyze Zomato data.

1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

I have used Google Collab to load the data and analyze the data as well.

# In this analysis, we have responded to the subsequent inquiries: 

1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
   Conclusion: This suggests that a majority of the restaurants do not accept online orders.
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
   Conclusion: Dining restaurants are preferred by a larger number of individuals.
3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?
   Conclusion: The majority of couples prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of 300 rupees.
